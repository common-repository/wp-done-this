Adds a widget for users to submit their own 'dones' to iDoneThis and view their dones for the day.

== Description ==

If you use [iDoneThis](https://idonethis.com/accounts/register/?r=ucJKaPL1kpom)*, especially within a team, this plugin will be of use to you. It's extremely useful for your company/team's personal 'intranet' site.

It will add a new widget that allows users to submit their 'dones' and view their previously submitted dones for that day.

After activating and adding the widget, your users (who want to use it) need to enter their:

* [iDoneThis API Key](https://idonethis.com/api/get_token/)
* Team slug name (in the URL when viewing the team on iDoneThis)

There's not much more to it. I plan to add in some other features soon like a widget to view other user's dones, your own previous dones (from other days) and more control over what dones are actually displayed.

If you find a bug or want to contribute, please do so on the plugin's [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/bryceadams/WP-Done-This).
